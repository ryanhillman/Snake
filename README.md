# 🐍 Snake Game (Java)

This project is a modern implementation of the classic **Snake** game, built in **Java** as a portfolio piece to demonstrate object-oriented programming, event handling, and real-time game logic.  

## 🎮 Features
- Responsive gameplay with keyboard controls (arrow keys).  
- Real-time snake movement and growth when consuming food.  
- Score tracking with game-over detection on self-collision or boundary collision.  
- Clean, modular codebase with separate classes for UI, game loop, and logic.  

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Java (JDK 21+)**  
- **Swing / AWT** for graphics and rendering  
- Event listeners for keyboard input  
- Thread management for smooth frame updates  

## 🚀 Running the Game
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ryanhillman/Snake.git
   cd Snake/src
   ```
2. Compile all source files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```
3. Run the game:
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
This project strengthened my understanding of:
- Real-time game loops and thread synchronization in Java.  
- Event-driven programming with keyboard input listeners.  
- Object-oriented design principles (modular classes for UI, game state, and logic).
